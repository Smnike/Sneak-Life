Reflection:

This project was a two and a half day long [challenge/assignment]

I set out to build an application that would cause sneaker fans to see the proposed "Best Shoe" list and, most likely, immediately disagree. While this happens all of the time in person, on social media, etc. I wanted to provide the ability to also add to, remove from and/or update said list.

This was a challenging endeavor because getting all of the routing connections to work properly was a [challenge]. The MOST unexpected obstacle was - and still is - the inability to get images to show up in any part of the app. This resulted in me working on improving the visuals in other ways.
